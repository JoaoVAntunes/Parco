# Parco
Parco is a parking management system designed to streamline vehicle entry/exit, payments, reservations, and reporting. Built with React + Tailwind on the frontend and .NET 8 (ASP.NET Core, EF Core, PostgreSQL, Redis) on the backend, it supports both web (PWA, offline-ready) and desktop (Electron/Tauri) deployments from a single codebase.
